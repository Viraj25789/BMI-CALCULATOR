# BMI-CALCULATOR
# BMI Calculator Web App

This is a **simple BMI (Body Mass Index) Calculator built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. 
It allows users to enter their *height and weight*, calculate their *BMI*, and get a result indicating if they are underweight, normal, or overweight.

The app also stores the BMI calculation data using PHP (via `save_data.php`), making it useful for learning form handling and basic backend integration.
